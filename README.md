# CWR Lab Schema Library

Welcome to Schema Library for the CWR lab projects.  View and search schemas in the [Schema library](https://agrifooddatacanada.github.io/CWRlab/) and contribute your schemas here on the GitHub backend. 

This is a library of active schema projects, refining, updating and documenting projects to reflect their contents.

## If you wish to add your schemas to the Library

Write your schema using the [Semantic Engine](https://www.semanticengine.org).

Generate a markdown version of your schema.

Copy your schema markdown file into the folder Schemas.
