# CWR Lab Schema Library

Welcome to Schema Library for the CWR lab projects.

This is a library of active schema projects, refining, updating and documenting projects to reflect their contents.

## If you wish to add your schemas to the Library

We are using the ADC's [Semantic Engine](https://www.semanticengine.org) to documentt our schemas.  You will download a .zip version of your schema which is a machine-readable version. Then on the main page of the Semantic Engine drag-and-drop your schema and generate a markdown version.

In [Schema library GitHub repository](https://https://github.com/agrifooddatacanada/CWRlab/), upload your markdown file (which you can rename) to the schema folder.


After you have made your file changes, commit your changes and wait for the documentation site to rebuild before viewing your results on the [Schema library]().
